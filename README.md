# unity_tilemap_multilayer_cnp_tool

This is a custom tool for copy and pasting tiles from multiple tilemaps all at once. Eventhough using multiple tilemaps as layers is a common practice, there did not seem to be any way to copy tiles from all of the tilemap layers at once. You have to do it one layer at a time. So I made this custom tool. It was made in Unity 2022.3.

When you select one or more game objects that have Tilemap components, the multilayer tile copy and paste tool will apear in your tool bar.
1. Click the tool
2. Make your selection
3. Retry if you need to
4. When you are ready to paste, click the paste tiles checkbox
5. click anywhere to paste the tiles
6. Pasted tiles will be on the same tilemap layer they were copied from.

Here is a demo of how it works.
